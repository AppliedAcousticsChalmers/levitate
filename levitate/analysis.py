    Converting a ratio to decibels depends on whether the ratio is a ratio

    where :math:`\log` is the base 10 logarithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : numeric
        Linear amplitude or radio, can be complex.
    power : bool, default False
        Toggles if the ration is proportional to power.

def find_trap(array, start_position, complex_transducer_amplitudes, tolerance=10e-6, time_interval=50, path_points=1, **kwargs):
    r"""Find the approximate location of a levitation trap.

    Find an approximate position of a acoustic levitation trap close to a starting point.
    This is done by following the radiation force in the sound field using an differential
    equation solver. The differential equation is the unphysical equation
    :math:`d\vec x/dt  = \vec F(x,t)`, i.e. interpreting the force field as a velocity field.
    This works for finding the location of a trap and the field line from the starting position
    to the trap position, but it can not be seen as a proper kinematic simulation of the system.

    The solving of the above equation takes place until the whole time interval is covered,
    or the tolerance is met. The tolerance is evaluated using the assumption that the force
    is zero at the trap, evaluating the distance from the zero-force position using the force
    gradient.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array : TrasducerArray
        The transducer array to use for the solving.
    start_position : array_like, 3 elements
        The starting point for the solving.
    complex_transducer_amplitudes: complex array like
        The complex transducer amplitudes to use for the solving.
    tolerance : numeric, default 10e-6
        The approximate tolerance of the solution, i.e. how close should
        the found position be to the true position, in meters.
    time_interval : numeric, default 50
        The unphysical time of the solution range in the differential equation above.
    path_points : int, default 1
        Sets the number of points to return the path at.
        A single evaluation point will only return the found position of the trap.

    Returns
    -------
    trap_pos : numpy.ndarray
        The found trap position, or the path from the starting position to the trap position.
