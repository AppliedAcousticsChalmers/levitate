"""Implementation of field wrapper protocol.

The API for the implemented fields consists of two parts:
the actual implementation of the fields in `FieldImplemention`
objects, and the wrapper classes `FieldBase` and its subclasses.
When objects of the `FieldImplementation` type is instantiated
they will automagically be wrapped inside a different object, which is
returned to the caller.
The wrapper objects are of different variants, corresponding to the use case.

Note that it is not intended that a user manually creates any of these objects,
since there are many pit-falls when choosing the correct type. Instead call the
implemented fields to get a basic field type and manipulate it using
the arithmetic API to create the desired functionality.
To validate that an API arithmetic manipulation actually does what was intended,
simply print the resulting object to inspect the new structure.

Basic Types
-----------
The basic type is a simple `Field`, which is the default return type from
instantiating. When called with transducer complex amplitudes and a set of positions,
the object evaluates the field implementation with the required parameters and
returns just the value from the field.

If the field is bound by using the `@` operation a new `FieldPoint`
object is created, and the position is implicit in the call.
This is more efficient for repeated calling with the same position,
since some parts of the calculation can be cached.

If the field is weighed with the `*` operation a new `CostField`
object is created, and the return from a call is changed. Cost field type
objects will return the weighed sum of the different parts of the implemented
field, as well as the jacobians of said value with respect to the transducers.
The jacobians are returned if a form that allow for simple calculation of the
jacobians with respect to transducer real part, imaginary part, amplitude, or phase.

If a field is both bound and weighted it is a `CostFieldPoint`, created either
by binding a `CostField` or by weighting a `FieldPoint`.
This will have the same caching and call signature as a `FieldPoint`, but
the same return values as an `CostField`. This form is the most suitable
for numerical optimizations.

    Field
    FieldPoint
    CostField
    CostFieldPoint

Squared Types
-------------
Each of the above types can be used to change the values (and jacobians)
to calculate the squared magnitude of the values, possible with a static
target shift applied before taking the magnitude.
There are four types, `SquaredField`, `SquaredFieldPoint`,
`SquaredCostField`, and `SquaredCostFieldPoint`, each
corresponding to one of the basic types.
They are created by taking the absolute value of a basic object, or by subtracting
a fixed value from a basic object. Note that the square is not apparent from the API,
which is less intuitive that the other parts in the API.
In all other regards, the squared versions behave like their basic counterparts.

    SquaredField
    SquaredFieldPoint
    SquaredCostField
    SquaredCostFieldPoint

MultiField
----------
MultiFields are objects which collect basic fields operating at the same point(s) in space.
Two objects of the same basic type (or a squared version of said basic type)
can be added together. If the fields are either unbound or bound to the same
position, a multi-field-type object is created. Again, there are four types, each corresponding
to one of the basic types: `MultiField`, `MultiFieldPoint`, `MultiCostField`,
and `MultiCostFieldPoint`.
The two field-style variants will evaluate all included fields and return the individual
values from the included fields. The two cost-field-style variants will sum the values
from the included cost fields.

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    MultiField
    MultiFieldPoint
    MultiCostField
    MultiCostFieldPoint

MultiPoint
----------
MultiPoints are objects which collect multi-field-type objects bound to different points.
There are only two types: `MultiFieldMultiPoint` similar to a `MutiFieldPoint`,
and `MultiCostFieldMultiPoint` similar to a `MultiCostFieldPoint`. It is not possible to
have unbound multi-points, they would simply be unbound.
A `MultiFieldMultiPoint` returns the values from the stored fields.
A `MultiCostFieldMultiPoint` will sum the values and jacobians of the stored objects.

.. autosummary::
    :nosignatures:

    MultiFieldMultiPoint
    MultiCostFieldMultiPoint

Implementation Details
----------------------
To make the API work as intended, there are a couple additional
classes and functions.
The base class for the implemented fields, `FieldImplementation` is
only used as a super class when implementing new physical fields. See its documentation
for more details on how to extend the package with new field implementations.

The wrapping of `FieldImplementation` inside `Field` objects is implemented
in the `FieldImplementationMeta` class, in the `~FieldImplementationMeta.__call__` method.
This also accepts additional `weight` and `position` parameters to directly create
the other three basic types, instead of the default `Field`.

`FieldBase` is the top-level class for all wrappers, and handles evaluation of
spatial structures, caching, etc.
Similarly there is a `SquaredFieldBase`, which is wrapping the base `Field` objects'
calculation functions with the magnitude and square.
