    "## Summary\n",
    "- There is more distortion in all measurements than what is expencted from the theory for parametric loudspekers.\n",
    "- It is problematic to know where the distortion is coming from. It could be from the driving signal to the transducer (e.g. harmonics in the square wave or distortion in the amplifier), saturation effects in the transducer, or additional nonlinearities in air.\n",
    "- There is more distortion in the output from the Ultrahaptics board than from our self-made simple board.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot see the difference between the internal distortions in the hardware and the distortions from the nonlinearties in air. \n",
    "This makes it problematic to measure and idetify the nonlinerity in air. We would need this in order to design preprocessing methods for the parametric sound.\n",
    "It will also be good to have a deeper knowledge about the nonlinearity in air when combining the different modalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related issue is the measurement range. Since we cannot be sure of the exact levels of the higher harmonics, it will not be possible to use single tone measurements to identify the nonlinearities. A workaround for this is to use multiple tones in the ultrasonic range as the input to the transducers, which will modulate and create audible sound. By measuring this audible sound it is in principle possible to identify the nonlinearity.\n",
    "If the input signal is not sufficiently free from distortion, this identification method becomes too complicated to perform in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason that we need more control over the signals driving the transducers, and better understanding of what the board actually outputs given certain input values."
